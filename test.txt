The Advanced Institute of Industrial Technology (AIIT) is a public graduate school established to develop advanced professionals who will play key roles in the development of industries in Japan's capital of Tokyo. In light of the current status and near future projection of industries concentrated in Tokyo, the Institute offers two industrial technology graduate courses: the Master's Program of Information System Architecture and the Master's Program of Innovation for Design and Engineering. The twenty-first century is sometimes called the knowledge society; consequently, knowledge has become more important as a social asset than capital or resources, and knowledge is the largest element constituting the wealth of a society in today's world.
